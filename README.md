# 🧬 Game of Life (C++ Implementation)

This is a C++ implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** — a cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. It simulates how cells evolve on a 2D grid based on a set of simple rules, giving rise to surprisingly complex behavior.

## 🚀 Features

- Terminal-based simulation
- Customizable grid size
- Initial configuration (glider, blocks, random, etc.)
- Real-time visualization (frame-by-frame evolution)
- Keyboard input to start/stop/reset (if implemented)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C++
- Standard C++ libraries (no external dependencies)
- Optional: Raylib / ncurses for visualization (if you used any)

## 📦 How to Compile & Run

### Compile
```bash
g++ -o game_of_life main.cpp
